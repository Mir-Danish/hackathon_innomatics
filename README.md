# 🚀 Food Delivery Data Integration & Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
This project simulates a real-world data engineering + analytics workflow by combining datasets from multiple sources — transactional, user master, and restaurant master data — into a single analytical dataset.

The objective is to transform raw operational data into **business-ready insights** that can support strategic decisions in a food delivery platform.

## 🧠 Business Problem
Food delivery companies generate data across multiple systems. Without integration, it is difficult to answer critical questions such as:

- Which cities generate the most revenue?
- Do premium (Gold) members spend more?
- Which cuisines drive higher order values?
- How do ratings influence revenue?
- Are there seasonal ordering patterns?

This project builds a **single source of truth** to enable such analysis.
